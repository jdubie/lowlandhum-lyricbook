BALLAD OF SAUDADE

In the morning when the sky is grey
I’ll blow a kiss as I sail away
I’ll cross the ocean and I’ll reach the land
I’ll drop the anchor and I’ll kiss the sand
I’ll leave the boat there drifting off the shore
I’ll walk toward Eden where I was before
The lonesome ocean song is all I hear
The lonesome night makes the stars appear

Love, come to me
Love, speak sweetly
Love, make me whole
Love, don’t let me grow old

In the evening when the lights will fade,
I’ll stand on top of the roof and sway
I’ll move in rhythm with the silent clouds
I’ll play a melody that’s fierce and loud
Every night I’ll dream of you, so dark and bright
Your beauty’s written in night’s starry skies
The gated garden it is closed to me
There’s remnants left still, don’t you agree? 

Love, come to me
Love, speak sweetly
Love, make me whole
Love, don’t let me grow old

From the coast of Barcelona 
to the south of France
Boots of Spanish leather and linen pants
Her eyes shine with the beauty 
given only to night
That’s the type of beauty 
that God denied to daylight
Tomorrow morning when the sky is grey
I’ll blow a kiss and I’ll sail away  

2.
BROTHER STRANGER

Which of us is not always a stranger
Who has found the lost-lane into heaven

Which of us has known his lonely brother
Who has seen into his father’s heart

O lost

Who knows where to go to find the kingdom
Will our mouths keep searching endlessly

Which of us will not be broken by desire
With a heart too big and heaven pumping 
through the veins

O lost

Without words our lips move noiselessly
For the lost language we search endlessly

Who has seen April be the lion
I still see the rains come down in May

3.
BLUE TO BLACK

We used to laugh
Dancing around the garden

I used to cry 
You would smile and wipe my eyes
and you’d tell me this is not the end

Now you’ve faded out 
It’s dark where you used to be
Now you’ve faded out 
There’s a star where you used to be
I call your name but you say 
you can’t know me anymore

The weight of a bloodline 
The wake of your bloodline
Like a millstone tied around the neck 
rushing blue to black

4.
FIFTY-SEVEN

My soul is in the midst of lions

Awake my glory
Awake the dawn

The children of man 
whose teeth are spears and arrows
are all around me

Awake my glory 
Awake the dawn

5.
WAR IS OVER

I know you will not stop 
until you see us drop 
‘til you see us go up in flames like dying stars 
I know your only thought 
is how to win back what you lost 
cover eyes with frost 
and fill our brains with poison  

World War is over now
Through smoke I see the solid ground 

All those who have ears to hear 
still feel alone and draw near 
to warm breath 
and messages traced on cold mirrors
Too late, the seed escaped from the rock
the bird 
the hate 
And all things that truly start will someday 
finish

World War is over now 
Through smoke I see the solid ground

The time will come for silence to be found
The crippling walls, once mighty, 
crumble down 
The wonder of the world no longer drowned 
Blessing is the mourning stranger’s crown

World War is over now 
Through smoke I see the solid ground

6.
WHEN THE WORLD SLEEPS

There is a place I visit on some nights 
when the world sleeps 
Sun steals the memory of that distant space
I’m left with a hint of a taste 

I have a memory of heaven
but it’s thinning like smoke on the wind 
And I’m starting to doubt it 
I’m thinking it might never have been 

But the strong desire 
keeps my feet moving
The fire is not an illusion 
7. 
TWINE

We follow roads that wind like twine 
through country side
the poor and the fine

We rode in cars packed to the brim 
with books and friends
eager as kids

Seeking peace and silent sound 
but the road could not be found
Three times drove past and turned around

Home sweet home
our cabin in the pines

Couch rearranged
The stories spilled 
unguarded mouths as life filled the house 

Drip, drip, drip,
goes shower, sink 
keeping time on metal beneath 

Seeking peace and silent sound
Hours of heaviness profound

Moon soft moon 
your mist, sweet perfume 

8.
ALBATROSS

On a pitch black night with gossamer wings
beating out just around the edges   
A golden albatross burst onto the scene   
like arrows filled with fire 
poking holes in my dreams
Making way for a mountain 
and a river flowing free

I hear bells closer than my skin

A silver tone pierced a stock-still night  
The clapper struck the bell with thunder
Its echoes filled the earth 
with violent shaking sounds   
The people woke and stood 
on hill and hallowed ground   
The sound so bright it 
released them from their shadows

I hear bells closer than my skin
A coal laid on my tongue
A vision broke my thumbs
A golden thorn pierced my scorn 
and a newer light is born

A man pulls back the string 
on a single bow of bronze
It was fitted with the sharpest of arrows
He aimed it toward the void
He aimed it to destroy
the crippling lies of cynics and fools
Yet the tip was filled with seeds
which grew up into mighty trees
and the forest came back up around the city

9. 
POCKET KNIFE

I saw a haystack under a tree
I found a pinwheel and took it home with me

Upstairs by the window
snow is drifting soft, and its bright 
Upstairs by the window
no one can see me looking outside

10.
WHITE STONE

The faces of a mirror ripple like stirred water
My hand pushed through the silver 
to touch the face of God   
From my mouth you’re always drawing 
dark sayings from of old   
I’m talking like my father 
and bearing my brother’s load

I’ll tell the truth to children 
not dress it up in white
The house is one divided 
The clock can’t be turned back

Come save the weak and needy   
Give justice to the weary   
The wanderer is bleary-eyed   
The sunlight has grown cold

This one’s for the prisoner
You hear his lonely sigh 

I want my white stone 
Tell me my name 

11.
LINENS

Little tiny bud 
soft, sweet, and shy
Sings with her eyes closed
Dreams by her window
Paper is her kingdom on the floor of her room

I remember the classroom 
where I heard of the good news
I sang out the true songs with glue 
on my fingers from a new paper Jesus
and I was content

Studied for good grades 
and I spoke not the bad words 
I prayed for my sad friends and 
worshipped the romance deep in my garden
But man built my garden 
and filled it with lies
Little tired flower lost all her color 
She’s singin’ a new song 
but she cries in the shower 
She worships the beauty
but that’s all there is 
Life feels too long 

And that’s all there is

I remember the moment 
you breathed on my small heart
Your voice was a whisper at the foot of my bed
My room washed in yellow 
with the sun of a new day
I sang with my eyes closed
I wasn’t afraid 

12.
MY HOUSE IS EMPTY

Don’t send me to Sheol
It’s too much like home 
I’ve known the palest mornings
I’ve held back locusts swarming 

O don’t leave

Don’t send me to Sheol
The cracked earth’s too tired
I see the highways crawling 
I hear the tall trees longing

My house is empty

I’ve seen a holy man cut down
I’ve lived in shadows of great fathers
I’ve watched my generation sleep

13.
NOISE OF DAY

We wait for it 
however long

I don’t need to know, though I choke
I don’t need to know
just bless me before you go

Give me a child
Don’t let me waste

I don’t need to know, though I choke
I don’t need to know
Just bless me before you go

My sheets are warm
I eat my tears
until the noise of day

We wait for it

14.
HOW LONG

How long, O my God, how long
How long until I see you
My bones ache    
You know my heart’s awake 
so how long until I see you 

She saw a rose and it won’t let her go

They ask me:    
Where have you been and 
where are you going? 

“I build cathedrals in the hearts 
of the people that I know”

I’m waiting for Mount Zion

15.
FOUR SISTERS (PART ONE)

One sister walks the wasteland
Never found a way in
Hunger and thirst 
pale face curses fell from full lips again

Who has a soul that’s not fainting?
Who has a soul that’s not faint?
Use your voice

Another sets up shop in a blackout 
huddled in the dark corners
She hates the word of healing,
spitting on wisdom
so now it’s hard labor

Where is the friend of the stubborn?
Who will shatter the bars of iron?
Use your voice
With her ear inclined and her aching eyelids
Her little neck so tender
The echo came back with a different timbre
An octave remembered
A substance delivered
A city to dwell in

Use your voice

16.
FOUR SISTERS (PART TWO)

Can’t get hungry anymore
I bought everything they’re selling
Broke my fingers on my own
then cried about my suffering
Everything I put on my tongue is salt

My crying sounds like singing,
kneeling at the final gate
My knees struck ground
I saw the serpent on the staff

My sister went down to the sea in a ship
doing business on the great waters
She saw unspeakable things 
in the corners of the world

The hand of God stirred up the churning ocean
The waves cursed and sputtered
Made my sister a drunkard
with a melted heart
and only one way out of the dark

17.
FOUR SISTERS (PART THREE)

When they are brought low
When they are diminished
Through oppression and sorrow
he pours contempt on princes
and makes them wander 
in trackless wastes
But he raises the needy out of affliction

The upright see it and are glad
All wickedness shuts its mouth

Whoever is wise
let him attend to these things

18.
ODELL

I bathe in light and watch the steam
whispering, perfect milky porcelain
it is not me
My pressed down soul

Henri, Henri,
through you I see
A mother’s love
No room for me

I gave my sons all that I had
One flew on home
Life’s bitter seed
The other broke,
never a man
He paints me now
My pressed down soul

He paints the gleam of china fine
The hue of day, a sharp white wine
Green lungs that breathe outside my door
My pressed down soul

19.
OLIVIA

Woman and a man
lean against the wind
Fist in pocket, hand in hand
utilitarian grip
Backs weighed down, heavy laden
Saturday breakfast sitting inside them
Off they go to win the day
Hoods and special shoes, stronger than the rain

Olivia,
here we are
I want to have a good time with you
O spread a smile
across your face
I want to have a good time with you

Woman and a man
squeeze an orange into a bowl
Slotted spoon in hand to pull
sleepy seeds out one by one

Hazy August day
Don’t let it sink away
Open windows, shrill cicadas
like grinding metal heat radiators
Sunlight tracing shapes on the wall
Get your body in the water before it turns fall

20.
CHARLESTON

Charleston
She went South for the money

You’d better walk it off
Better walk it off

Bitter rain
Smoke on the corner

Where is brother Cain
when I don’t get my way
Don’t get in my way

She’s picking up the pieces
calling out the descent
Such fine furniture sitting in the basement 
Such strong cigarettes
drawn by delicate red
Pray for sleep after
Pray you can sleep after
A little folding of the hands and poverty stabs on a sunny afternoon

21.
JACK OF HEARTS

The Jack of Hearts with wily eyes
corrupted without intention
Moving with grace and ease like violence
he marked his prey with friendship
Donning a mask of sneering glass
the Jack marched North for good
Electric wind at his back
and the fire of the misunderstood

The Jack of Hearts pulled strings without
lifting any fingers
His dark brow charms slowly destroyed
defenses like waves on sandstone
Women wept as they got swept up
into the Jack’s deep shadow
Men felt small, knelt down and scrawled
out excuses in sunburned dirt
Reasons why what he said hurt

Some men shout to be heard
others whisper to be ignored

But the Jack of Hearts 
left the listener in the dark
And while smiling breathed out disaster
unconcerned, and weeping with laughter

March on, march on
Revolution in the dark
Compromise breeds confusion
March on, march on
Don’t let silence mar the throne
Never look a man in the eye
March on, march on
Don’t look closely at the horn
where the white knuckles grasp the leather

March on, march on
Don’t let silence mar the throne
Never look a man in the eye
March on, march on
wearing darkness like a gown
Keep on moving
You’re a rich man now

22.
1999

Now, when I close my eyes
rooms dematerialize
I soar above salt water
warm sand under my hands
I’m free

I have all the time in the world
I’m free

I used to keep quiet
before I learned words
My bones dried, were chalk
Hot and heavy, I balked
Hot and heavy
In the world
weary

I opened the door
Dug up the photograph
Ball point pen royal blue:
“I have failed 1999.”

Blessed is the one whose sin is gone

She cried

23.
OLDER, WISER

Her kitchen is a lantern
She makes her preserves 
in reel to reel
Voices are the ribbons
Trace the maze
Pocket the past

I hope my body is only a shell
A shadow at dusk
The ring of a bell

Won’t put the research in the ground
She lives on raw nerves
meals ready to eat
Voices are the engineers
Fall for the warnings
Get word to your family

Red phone ring
I want to speak to the president please
Red phone ring
Won’t someone send us a common enemy

World War 3
Been waiting for you to undo me
Red Phone ring
What can I leave to my family? 
What’s it about if it’s not about me?



24.
FOLD

Stained glass reminds me of the way
I got refracted by my playmates
I tried to seize power from them 
with my imagination

I tied a rope around a stick
so I could make ends meet
A little breeze 
awake the spark and nudge the heat
Making ends meet

All in the how we pick it up
All in the how we fold it up

25.
LAUTREC

The death of your brother 
put the nail in the coffin

O where is your father?
Did you see him in the horses?

When you should’ve been growing 
you broke both your thigh bones

You smash all the mirrors
and sing through the canvas

Death came early and stayed too long
Often told the truth

26.
NIGHTDRIVING

We drive into the dark
Trees forming a line into the dark
I don’t know where we are
or when we’ll get there
or where there is

We are carving our
fading tunnel into the night

Lightning on power lines
Metronome strobe divides
the road
Blurs all the time
Stay in the lines

White noise
Tires breathing
The ocean in a shell

27.
ROLLING AND ROLLING

Riding my bike
Pushing as hard as I can
Blowing off steam
and energy I don’t understand
My friend Charles has an older brother
They live down the street
He slipped us a magazine
I felt big but I looked through squinted eyes
My mom found us on the trampoline

Growing up is like gravity
Steady erosion
I wasn’t ready
The waves in the ocean
they’re rolling and rolling
Rolling and rolling

Five hundred miles
to the right of the Outer Banks
A volcano gave birth 
to beaches of the softest sand

Perched in caves looking at water
the color of jewels
I held my breath and beauty too
Who would hold these things
as close as I do
A box full of fuses

I’m hitching a ride
on the back of a ferris wheel
Take me to my manhood

28.
MORNING MEAL

I’m as balanced as a deer
walking across a frozen pond
Lost when I don’t get my way
I wear red eyes on a carnival ride

Won’t you come and feed us in the morning
Won’t you come and feed us 
with the morning light

I’m as silver as the moon
Taking credit for a borrowed tune
I try hard but I’m still cruel
I’m sad but not out of concern for you

I’m discerning as a dog
Easy to please, desires gone wrong
Down on my knees
Sickness, relief

Make me steady like a melody
Make me humble like a wheat field
Make me soft as an open window
Help me love what is unending
Help me love what is

29.
UNDER THE RUB

Brought low by the mistletoe
and recollected lost dreams
People mention my heroes
and clumsy, younger men
in the same breath
Arrange them on the same plane
I feel the weight of my absence
from the conversation
 
I keep looking at my cell phone
Can’t stop looking at my cell phone
 
My brother’s out on the mountain
My sister’s in the classroom
The town breathes on without us
We drive on through the afternoon
 
You’re riding quiet beside me
One more field whispers past
I need a laser
Landmark breaking up the stream

In the rooms surrounding
ten songs play at once
All of a sudden
a long awaited cheer erupts

I keep looking at my cell phone
Can’t stop looking at my cell phone

30. 
PALM LINES

Walking through cold, tall grass
You held out your hand 
like a teacup turned skyward  
Palm lines mirrored the rise 
and fall of the land 

We imagined ourselves 
tiny in your hand
Climbing the terrain of your soft skin 
meanwhile carried forward safely within 

One foot in front of the other, my darling 
Lift up your face 
so the sun can shine on it  
Frailty is a friend 
who makes you sleep ’til the morning  
The mountain is high 
but it’s floating on the ocean

Weariness hitchhiker 
was our guest all year  
Let me look into your palm again
If I lose my sight 
will the shadow draw me in?   

One foot in front of the other, my darling 
Lift up your face 
so the sun can shine on it  
Frailty is a friend 
who makes you sleep until the morning
The valley is dry 
but a steady rain is coming


31.
ADONAI

I see man put an end to starlight
moving mountains
Underneath the earth:
fire and blackness
Even dust turns to gold

Adonai

Man puts his hand to the flinty rock
dams the stream
His eye sees every precious thing

Adonai

Oh, my eye caught a flicker in the eaves
Wind singing to me 
with the feathers and the leaves
Moss on the bones of an oak tree
Fiber wove through all that be

O Adonai

O holy grove of the rhododendron
Looking like a child for a secret emblem
Wild enough to keep us guessing 

O Adonai

Our brother William 
slipped through the nightshade
marveler once and always
I know you saw his face

32.
IN FLIGHT

Sing me a lullaby  
I’m so far from home 
that I feel I could cry

I’m looking down the well
hearing my name in a dark refrain

I guess it’s time for trains
All lonesome singers start sounding the same

Saw a flock of birds in flight
making patterns, catching sunlight
They seemed to read each other’s minds
I want to move that way with you

Sometimes a walk is all you need
When the world is ugly 
and your mind turns black
a walk might be all you need

Be my friend today
Don’t have much to say 
but I’ll try to be myself
just be my friend today

Saw a field of wheat that swayed
rolling like an ocean wave
sprays of gold instead of gray
I want to move that way with you

Love is patient and kind
Hallelujah for a friend to remind me 
that love is patient and kind

33.
COMPASS

I need a compass now
How tiring, 
all this binding and tearing

Oh sweet
a truth to crush a lie
First day of spring
warm washcloth on the brow

My heart wanders 
from door to door
I need a word from your mouth

Oh sweet
a truth to crush a lie
Clear autumn blue 
revives the sunburned eyes

34.
FAMILY TREE

How am I to act?  
How am I to think?  
Suddenly you are, 
from a thrash of heat
Little recklessness
little consequence
little waking breath stirring in my chest

Oh what am I to you?  
You do not belong to me
My heart wrung out
I still feel you 
swinging from my family tree

Should I stick around 
to watch you from the window
you are safe and warm
I’ll only confuse you

Hold tight 
to what I thought I knew 
about decision
My womb is sheltering 
a swelling 
soured emotion

Hold tight 
to what I think I know 
about redemption
Lord, kill this phantom
swinging
gaping hole sensation

I am still a child
raging in my bed
Can you hold us both?

35.
VEDAUWOO

Vedauwoo
five weeks too full 
to see you

Canyons by the million
mountains blue
five weeks too full 
to know you

Don’t you know I love you?  
It’s further down
born before the ashes blocked the sun

Vedauwoo
mind weak
words too soft 
to reach you
36.
FOLDED FLOWERS

Hive
picture the inside of a beehive
Eu de amber light
perfection in a clock design
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You’re a bee in the hive

Let me just see your calm face
Remember that it is not a race
We’re just folded flowers

Invent an unknown animal 
and observe him playing on the front lawn: velvet nose to the ground
ears at attention 
Go to your friends and say, 
“What do you see in me? 
Am I an animal?”  

Let me just see your calm face
Remember that it is not a race
We’re just folded flowers

Sometimes in my dreams 
people don’t have faces
Features are blurred
I can’t make out the shapes
It doesn’t bother me much
It’s just like my waking life: 
people all around me
eclipsed by my me-sight

37.
THIN PLACES

Turn screws and wooden legs

A million times a second
glitter on the bay 
like oil  

Cattails nod like monks
humble tonsures blur
Periphery diamonds kiss mercury

Andrew Wyeth, 
you always move my wife
The right number of birds
proportion of barn to sky

Every afternoon holds rubies
under rocks
in hidden caves
under rocks

Whales too
shiver and roll under a thin layer

So many thin places

38.
SOMEONE TO CHANGE MY MIND

I walked one Saturday 
looking for an opening
I walked one Saturday 
hoping to find 
someone to change my mind
prove I’m one of a kind

But all I saw was a black seagull

Why am I pure in my own mind
a strong column of white light  
I know I’ve been lonely 
and restless as the rest
Still, I am feral
dressing my best

All I heard was a laughing bird

Jesus Christ
he loves us very much
Love me
39.
WINTER GRASS

I’m not fresh
You could lay me flat 
like winter grass
trampled underfoot 
in the field out back

Crisp, hard air
catching in your throat 
and stinging your ears
Way up high 
glittering speck of a bird in flight

All becomes a husk
coarse fiber 
pulled and tucked
Warms the burrowed nest
A rabbit folds herself for rest

We await the crocus 
and the smell of thawing soil
The secret stir of roots 
stretching slowly 
under cool, dark cover

“One cannot not become 
simple and true in one day.”  
Gold in every season.

40.
YESTERDAY IS FOREVER

O mama
O darling
O slinger
O starling
O apple
O dawning
O simple
O stormy
O downy
O thorny

Yesterday is forever taking you back 
to an easier time
Silence every night
no need to squint to see the starlight

That’s just dew on the leaves
it gets born every morning
Born new every morning

O summer
O bigtop
O stammer
O shortstop
O failure
O hiccup
O seashore
O Stonecrop
O cherry
O flint rock

Yesterday is forever taking you back 
to an easier ride
Silence every night
no need to squint to see the starlight

That’s just dew on the leaves
it gets born every morning
Born new every morning
